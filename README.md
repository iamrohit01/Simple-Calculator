# Simple Calculator

A command-line calculator program written in Python that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear prompts and error messages
- **Error Handling**: Robust input validation and division by zero protection
- **Modern Python**: Uses Python 3.10+ match-case statements for clean code structure

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher (for match-case statement support)
- No additional dependencies required

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. No installation required - just run the Python file

## Usage

Run the calculator by executing the main Python file:

```bash
python main.py
```

### How to Use

1. **Enter First Number**: Type a number when prompted
2. **Enter Second Number**: Type another number when prompted  
3. **Choose Operation**: Select from the available operations:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division
4. **View Result**: The program will display the calculation result

### Example Session

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
What kind of operation do you want to perform?
Press + for addition
Press - for subtraction
Press / for division
Press * for multiplication
Enter Operation: +
The result is: 15
```

## Error Handling

The program handles various error scenarios:

- **Invalid Input**: If you enter non-numeric values, you'll get a clear error message
- **Division by Zero**: The program prevents division by zero and shows an appropriate error
- **Invalid Operations**: If you select an unsupported operation, you'll be prompted to use valid options

## Code Structure

- **main.py**: Contains the main calculator logic
- **README.md**: This documentation file

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by:

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Support for more mathematical operations (power, square root, etc.)
- History of calculations
- Support for decimal numbers with better precision
- GUI interface
- Support for multiple numbers in a single calculation
